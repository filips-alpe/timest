A tool to combine `git log` output with a calendar export (`.ics` file) to generate a list of completed tasks and time spent on each one.

Results are printed in hledger `timedot` format. See https://hledger.org/1.29/hledger.html#timedot-format

Example output:

```
01 Apr 2023
Create new Next.js app          .
Build this tool with ChatGPT    ...
Find out where my time goes     .... .... .... .... .
```

One dot represents 15 minutes. 4 dots represent 1 hour.

`.` 15 minutes

`..` 30 minutes

`....` 1 hour

`.... .... ..` 2 hours 30 minutes

Warning!
This is experimental technology. Use at your own risk.
Code was written mostly by ChatGPT.

Usage:

```
git clone git@github.com:filips-alpe/timest.git
cd timest
npm i && npm t
```

Now, copy your .ics file to `data/calendar.ics`. [Google Calendar instructions](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111).

Copy your `git log` output to `data/gitlog.txt`

Run `npm i && npm t` in your terminal

Status: though the output seems to be somewhat on point, I have not yet verified that it is indeed correct. Most computations were generated by ChatGPT.
